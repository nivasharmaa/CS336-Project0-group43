1.No everything is working correctly

2.I collaborated with my other three group members, Niva, Rishabh, and Rohit. We utilized the postgreSQL documentation for particular syntax such as INSERT INTO for inserting the rows from our preliminary table, SELECT DISTINCT for removing duplicate rows to clear up redundancy, and JOIN and JOIN ON for the joining of relations for reconstructing the final csv. We also checked the lecture slides quite often to remind ourselves of the definitions of 1st normal form, 3rd normal form, and anything relating to normalization and functional dependencies. I (Roman Perry) collaborated on creating the original functional dependencies for our SQL relations, and assigned each piece of data a data type, as well as noting the particular primary and foreign keys in each relation. 

3.I feel like some interesting questions this database could answer could be anything related to the housing market to equity. This database could answer questions like, can you predict how likely a loan is to get denied based on sex, race, income, or ethnicity, or what areas in NJ have the largest loan amount relative to the average income level of the county? 

4.We ran into problems creating the initial tables for our normalized relations due to the primary keys application_id and location_id, which are auto incrementing rather than taken directly from the preliminary table. This project took us about a week to complete.
